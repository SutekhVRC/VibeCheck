# Bluetooth

## Getting Connected

- The bluetooth interface you are using must support LE.
- I recommend using an adapter that can handle more than one device and has a **strong/long-range** connection.
- Make sure bluetooth is enabled.
- If using a bluetooth adapter make sure to disable your onboard bluetooth device in device manager if you have one.
- Plug in the bluetooth adapter.
- Start VibeCheck!

## Pros

- Faster response time. Basically instant response.
- Supports many different toys.

## Cons

- Can be less stable than Lovense Connect if the Bluetooth LE adapter in use isn't very strong.

## Requirements

- Bluetooth LE
- I recommend using an adapter that can handle more than one device and has a **strong/long-range** connection.
- If you are using an adapter, be sure any onboard generic bluetooth interfaces are disabled.

## Common Bluetooth Issues

- Your Bluetooth adapter may just be really weak (Feel free to ask for Bluetooth adapter recommendations)
- Make sure your Bluetooth adapter/dongle supports LE
- If your computer has an onboard bluetooth interface, make sure it is disabled if you are using another bluetooth interface (USB Bluetooth dongle).

- Windows only supports the use of 1 generic bluetooth interface at a time.
- [Windows OS only supports the use of 1 Bluetooth radio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-faq#how-many-bluetooth-radios-can-windows-support)
- If you are using VibeCheck before version 0.1.9 make sure to plug in the bluetooth adapter before starting VibeCheck.
